# Here's how to install and run the Dynatrace Platform Workshop!
Note: This is the first iteration of this workshop. There are many updates I'd like to do to reduce the footprint (maybe only use 1-2 app instead of 3) and to build out the use causes further. 

## Requirements
* Dynatrace SaaS Tenant with Grail/Platform
* K8s cluster
  * Tested Specs: 3 Ndoes	24 vCPU	96 GB	RAM
